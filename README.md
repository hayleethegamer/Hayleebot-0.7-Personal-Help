What I tell people if I'm telling them how to make a basic twitch bot

This is how I tell people to make there first basic twitch bot. It's based largely off Hayleebot 0.5 (https://github.com/hayleethegamer/Hayleebot-0.5) which was my first twitch bot, and hopefully should work in both python 2.7 and 3.5.

There are alot of comments in the code telling you what things do. You can look at it and try to make your own, or just use the code in ways that do not violate the license

(This Repo is no longer Maintaned, but could still help some people learn a thing or two, maybe)
